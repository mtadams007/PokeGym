# PokeGym

Class project to create a Pokemon Gym.

We were inspired by the original Violet Gym from nintendo's pokemon gold so we built our gym to mimic that design.

You need to decide which trainer you want to face, so you can click the on/off button under each side. Only one trainer can be on at once.

Isaac contains machop, pinsir, and charizard. Michael contains machamp, gengar, and magikarp.

By clicking on next and prev you can cycle between the pokemon.
